# Wrap Up

You now have a small but capable 2D game engine and a complete game built on top of it.

## What you built

- Core engine loop and timing
- Input handling, entities, and collisions
- UI overlays and state management
- Asset loading, audio, particles, and camera
- Event‑driven effects and wave systems
- System‑based architecture for scalability

## Where to go next

- Add save/load for high scores.
- Improve enemy AI and behaviors.
- Add new weapons, upgrades, or power‑ups.
- Explore spatial partitioning for faster collisions.
- Port the renderer to WebGL.

Thanks for building along!
